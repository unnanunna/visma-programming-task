## Programming task for Visma Summer Trainee 2023: Software Developer recruitment process.

### Aproaching the problem

 I chose to use Python, since it is a easy-to-use language and I haven't used it properly in a while, so I felt like I wanted to brush up my skills. 
 I started by creating the Identifyer class and implementing the functionalities to check the validity of the paths. The task required to use OOP so of course I kept that in mind while starting to build my program.  
 I also wanted to keep the structure and the style of the program clean and simple, as to make it easy to read and potentially in the future change some parts of it if needed. I didn't want to make more lines etc. just for the fun of it or to make it look more complex and impressive, the idea was to have all the needed validations but nothing more so adding and changing things is easy.

### Challenges

 Although Python is a familiar language, I haven't used it in a while so I found myself needing to relearn to not use semi-commas or curly brackets all the time. 
 I had some difficulty deciding how to implement the uri input to Client. I understood that since in the task it was asked to be put as an input it needed only to be that, a simple input, but I questioned if some sort of api was needed to use.
 Also making the program as simple as mine I questioned if I made it even too simple, but I didn't want to add more as I like easy-to-read code.

### Further improvements

  Truthfully, I don't have that much experience making back-end style codes like this, since my interests are more in front-end. I would ask from someone who has true experience how to improve parts of my code or if they see some serious mistakes.
  Of course if this was implemented in a real app, uri couldn't be asked only as an input from user. This should be changed, and if that was already needed for this task I apologise for my misunderstanding.
  I made quite quick tests, since there wasn't too much time to do this task, so I would test the validation functinalities more and maybe even implement different messages for different path invalidations. 
  Now the program shuts down a bit roughly only using sys.exit, so I would make a different way to do error handling and messages depending on how the requirements need it to be.
